Glitched Worlds SMB1 Patch
==========================

This patch adds a world select menu when starting SMB1.

You can control the menu by pressing select to toggle between items, pressing left and right to increment values by 1, up and down to increment by 16.

Download & Installation
=======================

First, download the patch here:

- [Version 1 - IPS](https://github.com/threecreepio/smb-glitchedworlds/raw/master/glitchedworlds_v1.ips)

Then simply apply that IPS (using for instance Lunar IPS) to the original, unmodified version of the Super Mario Bros. (US/World) ROM. 

The MD5 checksum for the ROM you should be using is `811b027eaf99c2def7b933c5208636de`.

Have fun!

Game Genie Codes
================

Some of the glitched levels behave kind of strange, and you might need game genie codes to get a good look at them. Here are some useful ones:

- `YZNLLYTX` - Disables the "TIME UP" message, so your game timer can't expire.

- `AANLIAAL` - Allows control of Mario when he's stuck at the top of the level.

- `AISSONOX` - Allows moving through walls

- `AISSONOX` - Allows moving through walls

- `EYSPAPEI` - Turn ground levels into water levels, and water levels into ground levels.

- `NYNPKGYE` - Disable automatic right movement (this will break actual cutscene levels)
